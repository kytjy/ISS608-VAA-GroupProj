Each observation corresponds to an entry from a student who participated in the PISA survey for students in the respective years, and the variables correspond to information from students on various aspects of their home, family, and school background.\n\n# 4 Data Wrangling\n\n\n```{mermaid}\n%%| fig-width: 8\n%%| echo: false\n\nflowchart TD\n\n    A[PISA Survey] --> A1[2022 Data Student Questionnaire] \n\n    A1 -.-> A11(Gender)\n    A1 -.-> A12(Socio-economic)\n    A1 -.-> A13(Psychological Wellbeing)\n    A1 -.-> A14(Schools)  \n\n    A1 -.-> A2   \n    A2[Combine 2012-2018]-.->A3(Longitudinal)\n\n    \n\n```\n\n\n\nThe data manipulation is performed in 2 parts:\n\n-   *Longitudinal data:* To conduct longitudinal comparisons of PISA scores of Singapore students across different years.\n-   *Detailed 2022 Student's Questionnaire data:* To compare the PISA scores between different groups of students based on factors such as gender, socioeconomic status (e.g., employment status of parents, immigrant status), and psychological well-being (e.g., feeling of loneliness, resilience when faced with challenges). On top of that, we aim to gain an understanding of the varying levels of importance and statistical significance of the various influences on PISA scores for different clusters of students.\n\n## 4.1 Filtering for required dataset\n\n### 4.1.1 The Longitudinal Data\n\nThe helper function below is designed to extract and process data for longitudinal analysis of student scores in Math, Science and Reading. Let's break down the function:\n\n1.  *Object*: The expected argument *object* retrieves the name of object which the survey is stored in.\n2.  `deparse(substitute(object))`: Returns the name of the object as a character string and stores this as a variable *filename*.\n3.  `filter()`: Filters the dataset to only include responses from Singapore students.\n4.  `matches()`: Select columns that starts with \"PV\" and contains either \"MATH\", \"SCIE\", or \"READ\" to extract the plausible values of scores related to the subjects of Mathematics, Science, and Reading.\n    1.  `^PV`: Matches the beginning of the column name with \"PV\".\n    2.  `.*?`: Matches any character (`.`) zero or more times (`*`), as few times as possible (`?`). This allows for any or no characters to appear between \"PV\" and the subject name.\n    3.  `(MATH|SCIE|READ)`: Is a group containing three alternative subjects to be matched, separated by `|`.\n    4.  `$`: Matches the end of the column name.\n5.  `mutate()`: Creates new columns to contain newly derived variables.\n    -   *year*: Represent the responses it pertains to, extracted from the file name using `substr()`.\n    -   *math*, *reading*, *science*: Calculates the mean plausible value for math, reading, and science scores for each student using `rowMeans()` applied across selected columns identified by \\`matches()\\`\\`\n6.  `select()`: Retains the relevant columns for our analysis.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlong <- function(object) {\n  \n  filename <- deparse(substitute(object))\n  \n  result <- object %>% \n    filter(CNT == \"SGP\") %>% \n    select(matches(\"^PV.*?(MATH|SCIE|READ)$\")) %>% \n    mutate(year = substr(filename, 9, 12),\n           math = rowMeans(across(matches(\"^PV.*?(MATH)$\")), na.rm = TRUE),\n           reading = rowMeans(across(matches(\"^PV.*?(READ)$\")), na.rm = TRUE),\n           science = rowMeans(across(matches(\"^PV.*?(SCIE)$\")), na.rm = TRUE),\n           ) %>% \n    select(year, math, reading, science)\n  \n  return(result)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nLet's get the required data using the `long` function defined and combine all the results from various years together in 1 dataset named *stu_longitudinal* using `bind_rows()`. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlong_2012_SG <- long(stu_qqq_2012)\nlong_2015_SG <- long(stu_qqq_2015)\nlong_2018_SG <- long(stu_qqq_2018)\nlong_2022_SG <- long(stu_qqq_2022)\n\nstu_longtitudinal <-\n  bind_rows(list(long_2012_SG,\n                long_2015_SG,\n                long_2018_SG,\n                long_2022_SG))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThe *.rds* file format is usually smaller than its SAS file counterpart and will therefore take up less storage space. The *.rds* file will also preserve data types and classes such as factors and dates eliminating the need to redefine data types after loading the file. For fast and space efficient data storage, files can be exported as RDS and re-imported into R using [`write_rds()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_rds.html) and [`read_rds()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_rds.html) respectively.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwrite_rds(stu_longtitudinal, \"data/stu_longtitudinal.rds\")\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstu_longtitudinal <- read_rds(\"data/stu_longtitudinal.rds\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nLet's take a look at the first 10 rows of our longitudinal dataset.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"datatables html-widget html-fill-item\" id=\"htmlwidget-8db3f7a0923ee78f7581\" style=\"width:100%;height:auto;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-8db3f7a0923ee78f7581\">{\"x\":{\"filter\":\"top\",\"vertical\":false,\"filterHTML\":\"<tr>\\n  <td><\\/td>\\n  <td data-type=\\\"character\\\" style=\\\"vertical-align: top;\\\">\\n    <div class=\\\"form-group has-feedback\\\" style=\\\"margin-bottom: auto;\\\">\\n      <input type=\\\"search\\\" placeholder=\\\"All\\\" class=\\\"form-control\\\" style=\\\"width: 100%;\\\" disabled=\\\"\\\"/>\\n      <span class=\\\"glyphicon glyphicon-remove-circle form-control-feedback\\\"><\\/span>\\n    <\\/div>\\n  <\\/td>\\n  <td data-type=\\\"number\\\" style=\\\"vertical-align: top;\\\">\\n    <div class=\\\"form-group has-feedback\\\" style=\\\"margin-bottom: auto;\\\">\\n      <input type=\\\"search\\\" placeholder=\\\"All\\\" class=\\\"form-control\\\" style=\\\"width: 100%;\\\"/>\\n      <span class=\\\"glyphicon glyphicon-remove-circle form-control-feedback\\\"><\\/span>\\n    <\\/div>\\n    <div style=\\\"display: none;position: absolute;width: 200px;opacity: 1\\\">\\n      <div data-min=\\\"381.76506\\\" data-max=\\\"697.85792\\\" data-scale=\\\"13\\\"><\\/div>\\n      <span style=\\\"float: left;\\\"><\\/span>\\n      <span style=\\\"float: right;\\\"><\\/span>\\n    <\\/div>\\n  <\\/td>\\n  <td data-type=\\\"number\\\" style=\\\"vertical-align: top;\\\">\\n    <div class=\\\"form-group has-feedback\\\" style=\\\"margin-bottom: auto;\\\">\\n      <input type=\\\"search\\\" placeholder=\\\"All\\\" class=\\\"form-control\\\" style=\\\"width: 100%;\\\"/>\\n      <span class=\\\"glyphicon glyphicon-remove-circle form-control-feedback\\\"><\\/span>\\n    <\\/div>\\n    <div style=\\\"display: none;position: absolute;width: 200px;opacity: 1\\\">\\n      <div data-min=\\\"420.67058\\\" data-max=\\\"686.44676\\\" data-scale=\\\"13\\\"><\\/div>\\n      <span style=\\\"float: left;\\\"><\\/span>\\n      <span style=\\\"float: right;\\\"><\\/span>\\n    <\\/div>\\n  <\\/td>\\n  <td data-type=\\\"number\\\" style=\\\"vertical-align: top;\\\">\\n    <div class=\\\"form-group has-feedback\\\" style=\\\"margin-bottom: auto;\\\">\\n      <input type=\\\"search\\\" placeholder=\\\"All\\\" class=\\\"form-control\\\" style=\\\"width: 100%;\\\"/>\\n      <span class=\\\"glyphicon glyphicon-remove-circle form-control-feedback\\\"><\\/span>\\n    <\\/div>\\n    <div style=\\\"display: none;position: absolute;width: 200px;opacity: 1\\\">\\n      <div data-min=\\\"377.13538\\\" data-max=\\\"682.6184\\\" data-scale=\\\"5\\\"><\\/div>\\n      <span style=\\\"float: left;\\\"><\\/span>\\n      <span style=\\\"float: right;\\\"><\\/span>\\n    <\\/div>\\n  <\\/td>\\n<\\/tr>\",\"data\":[[\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\",\"6\",\"7\",\"8\",\"9\",\"10\"],[\"2012\",\"2012\",\"2012\",\"2012\",\"2012\",\"2012\",\"2012\",\"2012\",\"2012\",\"2012\"],[544.7188,438.08226,685.62862,697.8579199999999,599.24442,381.76506,634.6860800000001,480.067,656.8858,571.43636],[531.9534200000001,447.91542,657.0573000000001,686.44676,571.82778,420.67058,633.5456799999999,531.5563,637.0406400000001,592.55926],[519.33982,377.13538,632.35734,682.6184,577.90004,386.83328,628.44088,462.73778,621.2607400000001,528.29168]],\"container\":\"<table class=\\\"compact\\\">\\n  <thead>\\n    <tr>\\n      <th> <\\/th>\\n      <th>year<\\/th>\\n      <th>math<\\/th>\\n      <th>reading<\\/th>\\n      <th>science<\\/th>\\n    <\\/tr>\\n  <\\/thead>\\n<\\/table>\",\"options\":{\"pageLength\":5,\"dom\":\"tip\",\"columnDefs\":[{\"className\":\"dt-right\",\"targets\":[2,3,4]},{\"orderable\":false,\"targets\":0},{\"name\":\" \",\"targets\":0},{\"name\":\"year\",\"targets\":1},{\"name\":\"math\",\"targets\":2},{\"name\":\"reading\",\"targets\":3},{\"name\":\"science\",\"targets\":4}],\"order\":[],\"autoWidth\":false,\"orderClasses\":false,\"orderCellsTop\":true,\"lengthMenu\":[5,10,25,50,100]}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### 4.1.2 The 2022 Student's Questionnaire data\n\nAfter perusing through the [Codebook](https://webfs.oecd.org/pisa2022/CY08MSP_CODEBOOK_5thDecember23.xlsx) and [Technical Report](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/pisa2022technicalreport/), the team narrowed down the questions from the survey that would yield insightful results.
