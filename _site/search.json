    "text": "Singapore has come a long way since gaining independence in 1965. Without natural resources, human capital development through a well-planned, world-class education system was a critical part of Singapore’s transformation from third world to first. Despite the internationally lauded success, Singapore’s education system is far from perfect – there still exists gaps in education achievement among students. According to the latest OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2022, which measures 15-year-olds’ ability to use their reading, mathematics, and science knowledge and skills to meet real-life challenges, socio-economic status accounted for 17% of the variation in mathematics performance in Singapore (compared to 15% on average across OECD countries). Clearly, Singapore’s success does not translate to success for every student. Why then do some students outperform others?\nOur team believes that knowledge is power. While causality cannot and should not be easily drawn between the various forces of influence and academic performance, a more detailed and nuanced understanding of these factors would highlight potential areas to focus on when engaging parents and students as well as developing education and socioeconomic policies for a more inclusive and equitable society."

The availability of a range of psychological, socioeconomic and environmental factors to choose from under the broad categories of individual, family, and school factors provides a multi-faceted view of academic performance."

One, users can conduct hypothesis testing for the various factors to determine their statistical significance vis-à-vis the PISA scores. Two, users can build a model based on multiple linear regression (and aided by multicollinearity checks) to obtain an integrated perspective of the interplay between different factors on the PISA scores."

    "text": "6.1 Univariate Analysis\nUnder Univariate Analysis, we aim to present three tabs. Firstly, to display the distribution of the three subject scores. Secondly, to show the proportion of responses for each independent variable and the distribution of scores according to each category within a variable. Lastly, the correlation matrix can enable users to visualise multicollinearity. Additionally, providing descriptive statistics for each variable could enhance understanding of their individual characteristics.\n\n6.1.1 Target Variables\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the first tab of the first sub-module, we aim to display:\n\nRaincloud plots to visualise the distribution of individual subject scores (target variables). The raincloud plot serves as a comprehensive visualisation tool by combining three essential components: a density plot, boxplot, and dot plot. The density plot illustrates the distribution’s shape and density, offering insights into its overall pattern. Meanwhile, the boxplot provides a summary of central tendency, spread, and any outliers present, aiding in the quick identification of key statistical characteristics. Lastly, the dot plot displays individual data points, allowing for a detailed examination of specific values or patterns within the data. Together, these components offer a holistic view of the data distribution, facilitating efficient exploration and interpretation.\nTernary plot offers a unique perspective by visualising the performance across three different subjects simultaneously. This plot enables users to explore the interplay among the subjects, identifying any correlations or dependencies that may exist between them. By representing data points as proportions of three variables within a triangular coordinate system, the ternary plot provides a concise and intuitive representation of multidimensional relationships, enhancing the understanding of how performance in one subject may relate to or influence performance in the others.\n\n\nFeatures of this visualisation\n\nSubject Selection Check Box: Users can select which subjects to display, allowing for the visualisation of one subject at a time or multiple subjects simultaneously. This flexibility enables users to focus on specific subjects of interest or compare multiple subjects within the same plot.\nYear Selection Option: Users have the option to choose the year of reference for the data displayed. This feature enables temporal analysis, allowing users to track changes or trends in performance over time. By selecting different years, users can explore how performance in the chosen subjects evolves across different time periods, providing valuable insights into longitudinal patterns or shifts.\n\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Independent Variables\nIn this section, we utilise the following visualisations:\n\nStacked Bar Charts: These charts illustrate the proportion of responses for each independent variable. By stacking the bars, users can visually compare the distribution of responses across different categories within each variable, gaining insights into the relative frequency of each response option while also observing the overall distribution of responses for each variable.\nDensity plots: For comparison of the distribution and variability of scores for each categorical values of a variable.\nKey Statistics from Confirmatory Data Analysis (e.g., p-values from ANOVA test): These statistics offer additional insights into the relationships between variables, providing evidence to support or refute hypotheses and conclusions drawn from the data analysis.\n\nKindly note that for brevity, the names and number of variables in the prototype below are indicative and non-exhaustive :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures of this visualisation\n\nSubject Selection Check Box: Users can choose which subjects to display, either individually or simultaneously, using checkboxes.\nVariable Selection Option: Users have the ability to select variable(s) from the three categories. This feature allows users to focus on specific variables and explore their relationships with subject scores, facilitating targeted analysis and interpretation.\n\n\n\n\n6.1.3 Correlation Matrix\nThe correlation matrix provides insights into multicollinearity and correlation coefficients. This matrix displays the pairwise correlations between variables, revealing the strength and direction of relationships between them. By visualising the correlation coefficients, users can identify potential multicollinearity issues, where independent variables are highly correlated with each other. This information is crucial for regression analysis, as multicollinearity can distort coefficient estimates and reduce model accuracy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures of this visualisation\n\nVariable Selection Option: Users can choose the number and types of variables to test for multicollinearity. This flexibility allows users to customize the analysis based on their specific research questions or analytical needs.\nCorrelation Coefficient Display: The correlation coefficient is displayed in each tile of the correlation matrix, which indicates the strength and direction of the relationship between pairs of variables, providing users with valuable insights into the degree of multicollinearity present in the data."
