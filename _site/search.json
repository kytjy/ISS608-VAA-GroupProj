    "text": "Singapore has come a long way since gaining independence in 1965. Without natural resources, human capital development through a well-planned, world-class education system was a critical part of Singapore’s transformation from third world to first. Despite the internationally lauded success, Singapore’s education system is far from perfect – there still exists gaps in education achievement among students. According to the latest OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2022, which measures 15-year-olds’ ability to use their reading, mathematics, and science knowledge and skills to meet real-life challenges, socio-economic status accounted for 17% of the variation in mathematics performance in Singapore (compared to 15% on average across OECD countries). Clearly, Singapore’s success does not translate to success for every student. Why then do some students outperform others?\nOur team believes that knowledge is power. While causality cannot and should not be easily drawn between the various forces of influence and academic performance, a more detailed and nuanced understanding of these factors would highlight potential areas to focus on when engaging parents and students as well as developing education and socioeconomic policies for a more inclusive and equitable society."

    "text": "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) via Data Visualisation\nFor this project, EDA in the form of visualisation techniques will be applied to give the public the ability to obtain evidence-based insights through visual analytics. The availability of a range of psychological, socioeconomic and environmental factors to choose from under the broad categories of individual, family, and school factors provides a multi-faceted view of academic performance."

    "text": "Confirmatory Data Analysis (CDA) via Hypothesis Testing and Model Building\nFor this project, CDA will be two-pronged. One, users can conduct hypothesis testing for the various factors to determine their statistical significance vis-à-vis the PISA scores. Two, users can build a model based on multiple linear regression (and aided by multicollinearity checks) to obtain an integrated perspective of the interplay between different factors on the PISA scores."
